    <b>Moments in Selfies</b> is a collection of selfies I have taken continuously for the past two years. The evolution of the photographs documents time, location, and an emotional state. The photos are taken in a private moment, usually spurred by boredom. These selfies were not taken to look cute for the camera or for anyone else to see but to capture a fleeting moment in time, which would not otherwise be documented or remembered. When looking back through this collection of memories it is the emotional state of the specific moment and the general time that becomes the nostalgic part of photographs.

  The reflective nature of the intimate photographs is important to this platform. When creating each post the user does not immediately write a caption for the photograph. Instead, when a photograph is uploaded after being taken the date, time, and location is recorded, but the photograph isn’t publicly posted. Weeks later the user is reminded to reflect on that moment and that emotional state in order to write the caption.

  There are a lot of platforms currently that support selfies (hello Snapchat), but there isn’t a platform that is solely dedicated to taking and sharing selfies, especially not one that keeps them as an archive and acts as a timeline or shows any sort of progression.
