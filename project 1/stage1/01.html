<p>
The New Typography [1923]  
</p>


<p>
Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

  <p>
  	Typography is a tool of communication. 

  </p>

  <p>
  	It must be communication in its most intense form. 

  </p>

  <p>
  	The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

  </p>

  <p>
  	Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). 

  	</p>

  	<p>

  	This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
