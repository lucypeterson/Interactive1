The New Typography [1923]

 Typography is a tool of c &nbsp; o &nbsp; m &nbsp; m &nbsp; u &nbsp; n &nbsp; i &nbsp; c &nbsp; a &nbsp; t &nbsp; i &nbsp;  o&nbsp; n. 

 It must be communication in its most intense form. 

 <br>
 <br>

 The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

 <br>
 <br>

 Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions.

 <br>
 <br>

  Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
