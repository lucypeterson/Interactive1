Typography is a tool of communication. 

<br>

<div class="align">

It must be communication in its most intense form. The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

</div>


<br>
<div class="align">
Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. 
</div>
<br>
<div class="align">
Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics. 
</div>

<div class="nav"> 
    <a href= "../">&laquo; previous</a>
    <a href="../stage2/03.html">next &raquo; </a>
