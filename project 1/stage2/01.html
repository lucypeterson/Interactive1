<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typography is a tool of <strong> communication. </strong>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be communication in its most intense form. The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. 

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
